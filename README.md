# npm-rank

automated top 1000 npm packages collector. inspired by [anvaka's npm rank gist](https://gist.github.com/anvaka/8e8fa57c7ee1350e3491).

The raw data is available in [releases](https://github.com/LeoDog896/npm-rank/releases) as a [raw file](https://github.com/LeoDog896/npm-rank/releases/download/latest/data.txt) or as a [markdown file](https://github.com/LeoDog896/npm-rank/releases/download/latest/data.md).

Once I'm able to, I'll also make a `www` interface so no one has to download a `.txt` or `.md` file
